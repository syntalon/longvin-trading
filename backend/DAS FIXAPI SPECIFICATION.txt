	•	Introduction
	•	Terms

The purpose of this document is to describe how DAS FIX API implements various order types, and functionality unique to the DAS FIX. DAS FIX API is integrated into DAS Order Server architecture which can process one order in microsecond-level.


	•	Supported FIX Version

Supported FIX Version: FIX4.2


DAS has the flexibility to customize and manipulate FIX message formats and their respective field values based on business requirements.

* Please note that we do not support Encryption.


	•	Session Level Messages

	•	Standard Message Header

All types of messages, application, administrative, etc., will be preceded with a header. The standard elements that make up a FIX header are message type, length, destination, sequence number, origination point and time.
The following table lists the fields used in a standard message header in FIX 4.2. The * denotes a required field per FIX.

Field
Name

Description
8

	•	This must be the first field in the message.

122
OrigSendingTime
N
Time original message was sent (if available). Used on a






Resend

Format: YYYYMMDD-hh:mm:ss (expressed in UTC/GMT)


	•	Standard Message Trailer

Each message is followed by a standard trailer. The trailer is used to segregate messages and contains the three-digit character representation of the Checksum value.

Field
Name
Required
Description

	•	Logon

The logon message authenticates client establishing a connection to DAS system. The logon message must be the first message sent by the application requesting to initiate a FIX session.

	•	Resend Request

The resend request is sent by the receiving application to initiate the retransmission of messages. This function is utilized if a sequence number gap is detected, if the receiving application lost a message, or as a function of the initialization process.
The resend request can be used to request a single message, a range of messages or all messages subsequent to a particular message.

	•	Sequence Reset

The sequence reset message is used by the sending application to reset the incoming sequence number on the opposing side.

If the GapFillFlag field is present (and equal to Y), the MsgSeqNum should conform to standard message sequencing rules (i.e. the MsgSeqNum of the Sequence Reset-GapFill message should represent the beginning MsgSeqNum in the GapFill range because the remote side is expecting that next message).

If the GapFillFlag field is not present (or set to N), it can be assumed that the purpose of the sequence reset message is to recover from an out-of-sequence condition. The MsgSeqNum in the header should be ignored.
